									<h2><a href="HP_Pages/boundary_peak.html">9. Nevada — Boundary Peak, 13,147'</a></h2>
									<p>My 4th State HP, Boundary Peak was a slog! Starting at over 9,000' we hiked 10+ miles round trip with over 4,000' of elevation gain. Sitting at the northern terminus of the White Mountains on the border between California and Nevada, Boundary Peak is actually subpeak of Mount Montgomery which sits just across the border in California. Had a great time completing hiking with my dad and seeing some wild horses on the way!</p>

									<p>My 13th State HP, Black Mountain is the highpoint along a ridge that serves as the southern end of the eastern border between Kentucky and Virginia. Located in a very sparsely populated area, Harlen County Kentucky, the summit is the site of the areas communication tower and you are very likely to have the whole trail to yourself. But watch out for black bears! We saw a couple on our drive down the mountain.

									<p>My 1st State HP, Mount Davis is best described as a wooded hill in the Alleghany Highlands. The forest floor is covered in some great ferns and carpets of moss. The top of the mountain has a nice fire tower, it was a little windy when we were there :). Check out the full story to see photos of the surrounding forests and some cool rock formations!
