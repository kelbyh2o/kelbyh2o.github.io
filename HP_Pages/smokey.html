								<h2>March 5th - Day 1 - Arrival and SC HP</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/highpointing/Smokey Mountains NP - NC, SC, TN, and GA HPs/airport_sleep.jpg" alt="" /></span>My trip actually started the night before. I was flying out of Pittsburgh on one of the first flights of the day and because the public bus does not run early enough in the morning I had to take it the night before and camp out in the airport. As airports go Pittsburgh is very quiet overnight and I pretty much had a whole terminal to myself. That did not make the ground (no sleeping pad) any more comfortable however. My setup is shown here on the left.   </p>
									<p>After meeting Tori at the Charlotte airport and picking up the rental car we zipped off to meet Tori's friends and hit up the Ashville REI for equipment (tents, sleeping pads, etc.) and a grocery store for food. From Asheville we headed southwest with Sassafras Mountain, South Carolina's state highpoint, in our sites.   </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/highpointing/Smokey Mountains NP - NC, SC, TN, and GA HPs/sc_hp.jpg" alt="" /></span>Sassafras Mountain is a drive up highpoint with a parking lot less than 100 feet from the top. A major concrete structure has been erected on top of the mountain with a nice compass rose and the North/South Carolina state line running through it. Views into each state were good, but nothing jaw dropping. I would rate it 5/10. Tori and I on the summit monument here on the right. With our first high point of the trip checked off we got back on the road to make it to our campsite at Smokemont in Great Smokey Mountain National Park.   </p>
