								<h2>July 22nd - Day 1 - Drive Up and Camp Outside Yosemite</h2>
									<p>Having visited Yosemite before and not wanting to have to get a pass, we drove from the Bay Area up to the edge of Yosemite National Park and camped for free on Forest Service land near Ackerson Meadow. If you are coming from the Bay Area and trying to get over Tioga pass for some peak bagging I highly recommend this area. You can sleep up above 6,000 ft and within a 10 minute drive of the park gate so you can be through the other side of the park early in the morning before you need a park pass to enter. Obviously, if you plan on stopping at all inside the park you will need a pass.</p>
									<p><em>Story continues after Day 1 photos.</em></p>

								<h2>July 23rd - Day 2 - Yosemite, Mount Dana, and Drive to Nevada</h2>
                                    <p>Our goal for day 2 was to summit Mount Dana (13,061 ft; 3,981 m), the furthest north 13er of the Sierra Nevada, and to drive on to Nevada to stage ourselves for Boundary Peak the next day. Up well before dawn (about 4am) we drove through the park on highway 120 in the dark, parking at the large dirt lot on the east side of the Tioga Pass park entrance just before sunrise. Feeling the altitude, we made our way slowly up past the last shrubs and into the alpine scree fields. A marmot accompanied us for a nice lunch and nice views on the summit. We didn't linger as we still had a decent drive across the border to Nevada. Our route up Dana and the routes we took for the other peaks can be seen <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/R8DH">here</a>.</p>
                                    <p>After scrambling back down to the car we coasted down to Mono Lake and on across to the Nevada border. Our intent was to make it to Queen Canyon Trailhead up in the saddle below Boundary peak. There is another route from the south side of the mountain that is less distance but more elevation gain, and up a sandy slope to boot. By starting at Queen Canyon we had hoped to avoid this. Unfortunately, the road to the saddle got a little spicier then anticipated and our Subaru Forester did not have the clearance necessary to proceed to the top without fear of doing some serious damage. We opted to camp about 1 mile below the saddle but still up at over 9,000 ft.</p>

								<h2>July 24th - Day 3 - NV State HP</h2>
                                    <p>The goal for the day was to reach Nevada's highest point, Boundary Peak (13,147 ft; 4,007 m), and get down. Having tagged Mount Dana at a similar height the day before and having slept at 9,000 ft we felt pretty good all things considered for our early start. We slogged up the old mining road to the true trailhead and were up on the ridge by sunrise just in time for the views. Our route for the day can be seen <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/R8DH">here</a>.</p>
                                    <p>The trail followed the ridge for about 3 miles through scrubby grassland with patchy trees on the north facing slope. To our surprise there were piles of poop scattered around. We eventually stumbled along the culprits, a herd of mustangs that called the area home. With the day heating up we made it to the base of the steeper climb up to the peak. The trail was a sandy scree mess for much of the ascent but some nice wildflowers served as good distraction.</p>
                                    <p>At the summit my dad and I borrowed someone else's sign for a photo op, took in the views, and had our lunch. Boundary Peak is on the far northern end of the grand White Mountain range, and is actually really a subpeak of Montgomery Peak just to the west in California. The ridge scramble to Montgomery looked doable except for the final section below the peak where you would likely need to scoot around the base to one of the other faces. Building clouds meant it was time to start heading down. We said goodbye to the mustangs on our way back and made it back to the car with a couple extra pounds of sand in our shoes.</p>
                                    <p>We bounced our way back down the mountain, crossed the Nevada border once again and headed for BLM land to stay the night. We stayed at Sawmill Meadow at the base of Glass Mountain with the intent to summit early the next morning.</p>

								<h2>July 25th - Day 4 - Glass Mountain</h2>
                                    <p>Our goal was to reach the top of Glass Mountain before sunrise. Our route for the day can be seen <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/R8DH">here</a>. Glass Mountain is the highest peak in the valley sandwiched between the Sierra Nevada and White Mountain Ranges and thus has excellent 360 degree views. It gets its name from the plentiful obsidian "glass" found on its slopes. Glass Mountain is the highest in a ring of mountains around the Crowley Lake basin which is actually part of one of the largest volcanic calderas on earth: the Long Valley Caldera.</p>
                                    <p>We started our hike around 4:30am, stumbling our way up a very faint trail in the dark. We reached the summit plateau at first light and hiked around while the sun rose just to the north edge of the White Mountain Range who's northernmost peak we had been atop the day before. Looking west we could also faintly make out Dana which we had been atop two days prior.</p>
                                    <p>There is a communication shack on one of the Glass Mountain high points that served as a great photo platform :D. My dad (a botanist) was mostly busy taking photos of a tiny little plant that was apparently of great interest. I was more interested in the view and the rocks.</p>
                                    <p>We made a loop around the summit plateau to the side of the peak that overlooked Crowley Lake to get a better view of the Eastern Sierra. After taking some final photo ops it was time to head back home. As far as views go for car camping and day hikes, this trip did not disappoint :).</p>

                                    <span class="image fit" style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/highpointing/Boundary Peak NV, Mount Dana CA, and Glass Mountain CA/Glass Mountain/glass_mountain_dawn.jpg" alt="" />Moonrise looking south down the Owens valley.</span>

Taking a look at Google Earth and using the ridge in the foreground to draw a line, I believe the peaks from right to left are Bear Creek Spire (which I climbed in 2018), Mt. Julius Caesar, Mt Gabb, and Mt Hilgard, although only Bear Creek Spire is distinctive enough to know for certain.</span>
                                    <span class="image fit" style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/highpointing/Boundary Peak NV, Mount Dana CA, and Glass Mountain CA/Glass Mountain/the_plant.jpg" alt="" />The special plant in question. I found this good one (I have better eyes).</span>

                                    <span class="image fit" style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/highpointing/Boundary Peak NV, Mount Dana CA, and Glass Mountain CA/Glass Mountain/botanist.jpg" alt="" />And here is the botanist in his natural habitat.</span>
