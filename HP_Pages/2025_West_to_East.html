                                <p>After many years of saving I finally got wheels of my own in March 2025. I decided to get my Subaru Outback, affectionately named Mu after the Greek letter used for the coefficient of friction, in California instead of where I am now based (Massachusetts) in part to make this west to east road trip possible as the christening drive (the other reasons being rust avoidance and access to power tools to build out the interior bed in my parents driveway). 
                                </p>

                                <p>The goals of the trip were simple enough: get the car across in one piece and bag as many not yet completed high points as I could along the way. While simple, often these goals conflicted, with some desired trailheads requiring some spicey roads, even for an outback :D.

								<h2>May 19th - Day 1 - Departing the Pacific and Sleeping in the Sierra</h2>

									<p>While I had intended to depart the coast near Half Moon Bay around noon to get out to the central valley before the Monday evening commute traffic, I sadly failed, leaving around 4pm and getting across the Bay Bridge just in time to join everyone else. Never fear however, I got to enjoy a nice dinner of canned Chef Boyardee ravioli behind the steering wheel in bumper to bumper traffic on 580 east. After picking up some duct tape, engine oil, and gas (the essentials) in Manteca I zipped across the central valley and up the foothills in the last light of the day. I had originally hoped to make it over the Sierra Nevada that evening but was getting quite tired as still an hour out from Sonora Pass so decided to find a pull out in Stanislaus National Forest and call it a night at about 6,000 ft. This was my first night sleeping on my new bed setup in the Outback and using the blackout window covers I had finished making that morning/afternoon (hence my delay). Could have been the exhaustion, but there were no issues sleeping that night.</p>
                                                        
									<p><em>Story continues after Day 1 photos.</em></p>

									<span class="image fit" style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/highpointing/West - East 2025/Day 01/01_Sleep Spot.jpg" alt="" />Aside from the photo starting at the Pacific, no more photos were taken on Day 1, which I attribute to my annoyance at the traffic and laser focus on getting up to altitude to ensure I got some acclimation. The above photo was taken the morning of Day 2 and shows the nice trees around my sleep spot for the first night. I imagine it would have looked similar if I had actually taken it on Day 1, sans light of course</span>                                   	
									
								<h2>May 20th - Day 2 - Eastern Sierra, Manzanar, and Telescope Peak</h2>
                                    <p>I was up and driving by 5am on Day 2, reaching the top of Sonora Pass (9,600 ft) at the same time as the first set of skiers were skinning up to begin their quest for spring snow. I coasted down through Bridgeport and onto probably my favorite stretch of mountain highway in the U.S., highway 395. The Eastern Seirra south of Bridgeport are absolutely stunning, rising almost 10,000 ft from the Owen's Valley floor to the crest. I took breakfast in the car just north of Mono Lake. Tortillas, honey, and almond butter is not quite five stars but the view certainly was. Out to the east I could barely make out Boundary Peak, the Nevada high point, at the far northern end of the White Mountains and Glass Mountain on the edge of the Crowly Lake Caldera both of which I climbed with my dad (link). To the west Mount Dana, another peak done previously with my dad, towered over Mono Lake. Further down I could pick out Bear Creek Spire and Mount Darwin, some of the few peaks I have climbed in these parts. The craggy cirques of the Eastern Sierra tried to lure me in as I drove, but my mission was firmly set eastward.</p>
                                    <p>I always try to stop by Manzanar, the former Japanese internment camp, when I am in the area to reflect. Given the current direction of the U.S., this times reflection was especially poignant.</p>
                                    <p>Lunch was had at the Lone Pine McDonalds. I choose a window where I could stare longingly at Mt Whitney, the California high point and the highest point in the lower 48, while I monched my BigMac and fries. I hope to do the mountaineers route in late April, maybe next spring, to avoid the pesky lottery. I filled up with gas and headed towards the middle of nowhere, where Death Valley National Park and its highest point Telescope Peak happens to be.</p>
                                    <p>While Telescope Peak is only 11,049 ft, it has the 22nd highest vertical prominence of any peak in the lower 48 (according to Peakbagger.com at least). Moreover, because it directly abuts Death Valley with a minimum elevation of 282 ft below sea level, it has a vertical perspective looking down into Badwater Basin that is greater than that you would have standing on Mt Whitney looking down into Owens Valley, and in a shorter distance. Telescope Peak is pretty cool for a number of reasons, and one that I did not fully appreciate until I got there was just how isolated it is, both from other peaks and from people. Ony ~5000 people live within a 50 mile radius of the peak, ~100 people within a 25 mile radius, and none within 10 miles. For you East Coast folks, the 50 mile radius example is like standing in Princeton NJ and drawing a circle that includes Manhattan Island NY in the north, Philadelphia PA to the south, Allentown  PA to the west, and a significant chunk of the Atlantic Ocean to the east and finding only 5000 people in it. Empty.</p>
                                    <p>On the drive I could pick out Telescope almost all the way from Lone Pine CA, and had plenty of time to contemplate how absolutely screwed I would be if I got bit by a rattle snake. I followed CA 190 toward Furnace Creek CA as it dipped down several thousand feet and then back up through the desert valleys accompanied but the occasional rental car on its way to the lowest elevation in the U.S. After tuning off on Emigrant Canyon Rd I didn't see any traffic besides some wild donkeys until I reached the Wildrose Charcoal Kilns. I had read that the road further to Mahogany Flat Campground on the ridgeline was rather treacherous without high clearance and 4wd, but hey, that’s why I got an Outback. I certainly was at least going to give it a go knowing parking lower meant an extra 1000 ft of elevation gain and 2 miles of hiking. To the surprise of the two jeep owners up at the top, I made it no problem. Slow is pro. It was now about 3pm and I parked just in time to chat up the last hikers finishing the~13 mile 3,250 elevation gain trek to Telescope for the day before they packed in their lifted Tacoma and headed down the mountain. And just like that I was alone.</p>
                                    <p>I decided it would be fun to try to get to the peak by sunset (I love racing the sun) so attempted to get in a quick nap after packing my bag and tossed and turned in the heat till 5pm when I started up the trail. The trail to Telescope is long, and for most of it the peak is in view, which really drags out the uphill. I startled a flock of quails who's collective wing flaps seemed to vibrate in my chest cavity, and even though it was broad daylight the shock got my adrenaline absolutely pumping. The good news was I needed it because I knew I was going to be cutting sunset close. So there I was having been at sea level the day before, now up at about 10,000 ft pushing myself as hard as I dared knowing I had to do it all back in the dark. Once on the long ridgeline the adrenaline gave way to awe at the expansive view into Death Valley and out toward Las Vegas on the left and toward the Sierra Crest on the right, pretty incredible. The juniper and pinyon pine gave way to bristle cone pines (known for being the oldest trees on earth) as I climbed, and as my and the peaks shadow stretched longer to the east. I was kicking myself at this point because I brought both my microspikes and ice axe just in case I encountered significant snow when I should have just asked the hikers who had come down. Only rug sized patches of snow remained.</p>
                                    <p>I topped out about 30 minutes before sunset and after taking some photos plopped down for my dinner break and to soak it all in. There was a lot to soak in. As the sun sank behind Whitney and the Sierra Nevada Crest on the western horizon I watched as the darkness slid up over the eastern sky, like being within an opening eyelid to darkness. My elation at my high position and the pastel sunset quickly turned to apprehension as I contemplated the many things I could encounter on the way down with no moon in the sky. A mountain lion? Big foot? Moth man? Extraterrestrials? Gatorade bottles in my hands served both as a constant reminder to keep hydrating and as a loud clicking device to break through the eerie silence and in theory scare off whatever baddies lurked in the darkness, or to at least provide some false sense of safety somehow. The headlight spot became my world as the landscape visible for 100s of miles in every direction slowly faded to inky black. I could pick out tiny towns as clusters of light far far off to the east. The stars were absolutely incredible, but being so hyper aware of how alone I was I could only bring myself to turn off my headlamp for two several minute breaks. I nearly jumped out of my skin when a reverberating low noise began emanating from up ahead. It sounded like a distant launching rocket, but it was close. The damn quails got me again. At least that’s what I told myself because I could not think of any other potential earthly culprit. I was ecstatic to see the trailhead register both because I was physically exhausted and mentally in the position of a small child thoroughly afraid of the dark again. It was about 10:45pm when I got to sleep. It had been a long long but successful first full day.</p>

								<h2>May 21st - Day 3 - Trapped in Death Valley and Drive to Humphreys Peak</h2>
                                    <p>The first rays of sunlight on the 8,000 ft ridge woke me around 5am. The day called for a ~6 hour drive to Humphreys Peak and depending on my timing I also hoped to stop by the Grand Canyon or Hoover Dam along the way.</p>
                                    <p>After a quick Greek yogurt and random items breakfast I started the drive down the mountain, navigating the rutted road with care knowing full well applying the brake too hard too suddenly would certainly cause me to bottom out on some very impressive sharp rocks. My only company on the road back to CA 190 was a kit fox that trotted on the road ahead of me for quite some distance before darting off into the scrub.</p>
                                    <p>I was making good time as I reached CA 190 which would take me to Furnace Creek and then on to the Nevada border, at about 8am. I saw what looked like cranes around the small buildings of Emigrant Campground but didn't give them a second thought. But as soon as I made the right turn I found three heavy duty flatbed tractor trailers blocking the right lane. Odd. I peered around them in the left lane and saw Caltrans crew trucks about 500 ft ahead. No flaggers though. Again, odd. I decided it was probably best to stay put but make my presence known by pulling to the middle of the road so they could see me waiting there. After about 5 minutes they noticed me and one of the Caltrans trucks started in my direction. I backed back into my land and rolled down my window to see what was happening as they pulled up.</p>
                                    <p>"How did you get here?" they asked seemingly with as much confusion as their question caused me.</p>
                                    <p>"Uhhh, I came from over by Wildrose Campground…" I responded still not really understanding their question.</p>
                                    <p>"Oh, so you came in from the south side to get there?" they pressed further.</p>
                                    <p>"No, that road is washed out… I came from this side yesterday and stayed up on the ridge overnight" I replied still confused.</p>
                                    <p>"Oh, the rangers said that no one was left back there. This road has been closed for 18 hours. A big rig <a href="https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/05/semi-driver-killed-crash-death-valley-national-park">lost its breaks and crashed here yesterday</a> around 2pm."</p>
                                    <p>Well, that explained a lot. I had passed by maybe 20 minutes before the accident, and it sounded like rangers had swept the area the previous evening, thus the empty road on the way out. I asked how long he thought it might be before the road opened. Don't know was his answer, and I believed him. I had no service there almost at the bottom of death valley to really understand my options but I really only had one: sit around and wait in the heat. I had plenty of supplies to hang out, and given it seemed all the necessary equipment (the flat beds, two dump trucks, an excavator, two front end loaders, and two big rig tow trucks) were already on scene and hard at work I bet it wouldn't be more than 4 hours before the scene was cleared. </p>
                                    <p>So I waited. I went back up Emigrant road a ways to a pullout that overlooked the scene, setup the window shades, rolled down the windows, and set out to finish up the last chapters of The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In that moment, I quite related to its "protagonist" earthling Arthur Dent, a tragic external event trapping me, but with no knowledge of the trap simply carrying on with my silly little quests of self-fulfillment.</p>
                                    <p>Some ravens showed up and cawed incessantly at me in the heat. I was going to be there a while so I thought I might as well give them some water in my empty yogurt container. Skeptical at first they eventually lapped it up happily. They stopped cawing and seemed content to just hang out. After a couple hours I decided to go explore the canyon around the road for a bit, watched some ants, contemplated the geologic history of the carved hills, and enjoyed some wild cactus flowers. Upon my return to my spot overlooking the accident scene the ravens returned again as well.</p>
                                    <p>It was about 11:30am when I spotted a "follow" car, snake of cars and RVs in tow, making its way down the road from the west toward the accident scene suggesting the road would soon be opened. I made it to Furnace Creek a little after noon, refilled water, and used my renewed cell service to figure out my plan. Unfortunately I wasn't left with enough time to visit the Grand Canyon, nor enough to bring the Gatorade bottle I had sealed atop Telescope Peak to the bottom of Badwater Basin for fun and instead started making a beeline east to reach Humphreys before sunset.</p>
                                    <p>The drive took me through the desolate desert flats on the border between California and Nevada. The path took me through Pahrump NV, which I swear must be the fireworks capital of the U.S. I saw at least five giant warehouses all with competing discount deal billboards plastered along the entire road. Las Vegas was what I expected, traffic. The remaining road to Flagstaff was mostly uneventful except for one really bad driver that would drive 90 in the slow lane slamming on their breaks inches before rearending trucks and cars there before deciding they should try to pass them instead, just why. Because of their chaotic movements I was travelling on average at a similar speed and thus unfortunately had frequent encounters with them. I made it to the Arizona Snowbowl parking area about 20 minutes before sunset which I watched before turning in for the night.</p>

								<h2 id="AZ">May 22nd - Day 4 - Humphreys Peak AZ and Drive to Santa Fe</h2>
                        
                                    <p>I tried to get up about an hour before sunrise but slept in for an extra 30 minutes and didn't get on the trail till about 6:30am. The trail is mostly long switch backs up Humphreys west flank through the trees. The trail is well traveled but unfortunately much of the snow had not yet melted out in the trees leaving many patches that were quite treacherous to navigate with no hiking poles and with the freeze overnight. The ridge was welcome milestone as the snow was no more and the view of the lesser peaks to the south and down into the adjacent ski resort were great. I caught up to a young man who was huffing quite a bit, and it made sense too as I found out he had come from Dallas the day before and was not standing well above 10k feet. Having already been at 11k the night before I felt pretty comfortable with the altitude. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>I got off trail a couple times on the ridge traverse to the summit because of my tendency to keep going up which took me to the ridgeline itself instead of the trail about 50 ft below. After a couple of false summits I made it to the top and had my little meal at about 9:20am. The Dallas gentleman and another young man joined me on the summit and we discussed other high points we had done before I headed down the mountain. All was well until I just about broke my right ankle (rolled it real nice), coming with a little too much speed down and not being as careful as I should have been with my foot placement. The possibility of my high pointing ambitions for the trip being just about over crossed my mind, but at the moment my first task was getting off the mountain which for a second also seemed out of the question under my own power.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After a much much slower descent I made it to the car and decided at the very least a stop at the flagstaff REI was in order to finally get some trekking poles. I got some In-n-out too, not knowing when the next time I would get to be graced by its flavor and desperately in need of a pick me up as I limped around with a ballooned ankle in Tevas. In somewhat higher spirits I began my drive east, not sure where I was going to be staying the night but hoping to at least make it to Albuquerque NM. The desert landscape was fun to pass through, looking a lot like radiator springs from the first Cars movie. I had PF Changs for dinner, way too much food but so good, and decided it would be wise to take a rest day the next day and ice my ankle each night to see how it does. After acquiring the ice I headed to my first rest stop sleeping spot and parked it in for the night just shy of Sante Fe NM. </p>

                                <h2>May 23rd - Day 5 - Santa Fe and Rest Day</h2>
                                    <p>Overnight I had iced my ankle and made sure I parked so that it was well elevated uphill. Lucky for me it was looking much less balloon like. Nonetheless a rest day was still in order to make sure the sprain didn't turn into an actual break. I am very familiar with ankle trouble unfortunately, having broken both and sprained them both more times than I can count. The plan for the day included a jaunt around Santa Fe, a trip up to the Wheeler Peak trailhead near Taos Ski Valley to scope out sleeping spots, and some sightseeing in the around the upper Rio Grande.</p>

                                    <p>Downtown Sante Fe is very cute architecturally, but what likely used to be mostly art stores is now dotted with high end shopping establishments. I did a bit of a look around the square and surrounding area, found an old church, America's oldest house*, and the state capitol building (which was quite refreshing compared to the many white marble buildings I was used to). *This is a dubious distinction on at least two fronts because 1.) the home was built when New Mexico was not a part of the U.S. and certainly not by Americans and 2.) there are nearby pueblos that are much older and seem functionally identical.</p>

                                    <p>My drive to check out the trailhead took me through the town of Taos and the Taos Pueblo which was quite an interesting vibe. There were two distinct types of cars on the road: luxury SUVs (think high end Range Rovers and Porsche Cayenne) or beater cars held together by bailing wire. I hope the imagery serves as a reflection in place of any societal commentary I could make here. It also goes without saying which category of car accompanied me on my drive up to the ski valley. On the way up I spotted a number of workable pullouts for overnight, having decided that I didn't want to sleep at the actual Wheeler Peak trailhead at over 10k ft.</p>

                                    <p>Feeling good about my prep for the next day's hike I headed to a section of the Rio Grande to take a much needed dip and hang out for the afternoon. I had a little trouble finding a spot that wasn't occupied by whipping fly fish lures but eventually settled under a nice tree in the water to cool down and continue reading my very British space opera.</p>

                                    <p>Sufficiently relaxed I drove to a Rio Grande overlook to munch on some snacks and then got subway for proper fuel for the next day. I pulled into my chosen overnight spot at about 8pm and was ready to sleep by 8:30pm in anticipation of my 5am wakeup (now on mountain time, the equivalent of 4am pacific).</p>
